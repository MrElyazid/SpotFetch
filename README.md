# SpotFetch :

A very simple python script to download spotify playlists using yt-dlp after exporting the playlist as a CSV file from [Exportify](https://exportify.app/).

- Simply get the CSV and start downloading
- No rate limiting since we dont use the spotify API
- Album cover art and metdata are embedded to the mp3 files
- Can resume downloads if stopped
